# go/pkgsite/source

Vendored from <https://go.googlesource.com/pkgsite/+/ef8047b111963f61f5a0b3ae5b464cdc18dc5f74/internal/source>,
because the source package is internal, and there's no plan to move it out anytime soon: <https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40477#issuecomment-868532845>.

Local modifications:

* Tests are not vendored.
* pkgsite/internal/stdlib's UseTestData flag is removed.
